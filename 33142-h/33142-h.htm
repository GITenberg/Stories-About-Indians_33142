<h2>STORIES</h2>
<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<h1>INDIANS.</h1>


<hr />
<p>The Indians were
formerly lords of
the soil we now
occupy, and obtained
a subsistence
principally
by hunting and
fishing.</p>

<p>They generally
lived in villages,
containing from
fifty to five hundred families. Their
houses, called <i>wigwams</i>, were usually
constructed of poles, one end
being driven into the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the other bent over so as to meet
another fastened in like manner;
both being joined together at the
top, and covered with the bark of
trees. Small holes were left open
for windows, which were closed in
bad weather with a piece of bark.
They made their fire in the centre
of the wigwam, leaving a small hole
for a chimney in the top of the roof.</p>

<p>They had no chairs, but sat upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
skins, or mats, spread upon the
ground, which also served them for
beds. Their clothes were principally
made of the skins of animals,
which in winter were sewed together
with the fur side turned inwards.</p>

<p>The Indians were very fond of
trinkets and ornaments, and often
decorated their heads with feathers,
while fine polished shells were suspended
from their ears.</p>

<h2>A PAWNEE BRAVE.</h2>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 175px;">

    <img src="images/p006-illus.jpg" width="175" height="268" alt="A warrior" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">Pawnee Brave.</p>
</div>

<p>The following anecdote is
related of a Pawnee
brave, or warrior, (son
of Red <a name="Knife" id="Knife"></a>Knife).</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-one, the
heroic deeds of this brave had
acquired for him in his nation
the rank of the bravest of the braves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The savage practice of torturing
and burning to death their prisoners
existed in this nation. An unfortunate
female of the Paduca nation,
taken in war, was destined to this
horrid death.</p>

<p>Just when the funeral pile was
to be kindled,
this young
warrior, having
unnoticed
prepared two
fleet horses,
with the necessary
provisions,
sprang
from his seat,
liberated the
victim, seized
her in his
arms, placed
her on one of the horses, mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the other himself, and made the utmost
speed toward the nation and
friends of the captive! The multitude,
dumb and nerveless, made no
effort to rescue their victim from her
deliverer. They viewed it as the
immediate act of the Great Spirit,
submitted to it without a murmur,
and quietly retired to their village.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN GRATITUDE.</h2>

<p>As an Indian was straying
through a village on the
Kennebec, he passed a
gentleman standing at his
store door, and begged a piece of
tobacco. The person stepped
back, and selected a generous
piece, for which he received a gruff
"tank you," and thought no more of
the affair. Three or four months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
afterwards, he was surprised at an
Indian's coming into the store
and presenting him with a beautiful
miniature birch canoe, painted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
furnished with paddles to correspond.
On asking the meaning of
it, he was told, "Indian no forget;
you give me tobacco; me make this
for you." This man's gratitude for
a trifling favor had led him to bestow
more labor on his present than
would have purchased him many
pounds of his favorite weed.</p>

<h2>INDIAN OBSERVATION.</h2>

<p>On his return home to his
hut one day, an Indian
discovered that his venison,
which had been hung
up to dry, had been stolen.
After going some distance, he
met some persons, of whom he
inquired if they had seen a <i>little</i>, <i>old</i>,
<i>white</i> man, with a short gun, and accompanied
by a small dog with a bob-tail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
They replied in the affirmative;
and upon the Indian's assuring
them that the man thus described
had stolen his venison, they desired
to be informed how he was able to
give such a minute description of a
person whom he had not seen. The
Indian answered thus:</p>

<p>"The thief I know is a <i>little</i> man,
by his having made a pile of stones
in order to reach the venison from
the height I hung it standing on the
ground; that he is an <i>old</i> man, I
know by his short steps, which I have
traced over the dead leaves in the
woods; that he is a <i>white</i> man, I
know by his turning out his toes
when he walks, which an Indian
never does; his gun I know to be
short by the mark which the muzzle
made by rubbing the bark of the
tree on which it leaned; that his dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
is small, I know by his tracks; and
that he has a bob-tail I discovered
by the mark of it in the dust where
he was sitting at the time his master
was taking down the meat."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN STRATAGEM.</h2>

<p>In one of the frequent
wars among
the different tribes
of Indians, a Pequot
was pursued
by a Naraganset
Indian. The Pequot
skulked behind
a rock, and
raising his hat on
his gun, held it
up just above the rock, so that the hat
alone was visible on the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>The Narraganset, who was at
some distance, perceiving the hat,
and supposing of course that the
head of the Pequot was in it, crept
softly up within a few feet and fired.
But directly he had the mortification
to find that he had thrown away his
powder. The Pequot's gun was still
loaded, and he discharged it to effect
upon the poor Narraganset.</p>

<h2>RED JACKET.</h2>

<p>It happened, during the
Revolutionary war, that a
treaty was held with the
Indians, at which Lafayette
was present. The object
was to unite the various tribes
in amity with America. The
majority of the chiefs were friendly,
but there was much opposition made
to it, more especially by a young
warrior, who declared that when an
alliance was entered into with America,
he should consider the sun of
his country as set forever. In his
travels through the Indian country,
when lately in America, it happened
at a large assemblage of chiefs that
Lafayette referred to the treaty in
question, and turning to Red Jacket,
said, "Pray, tell me, if you can, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
has become of that daring youth,
who so decidedly opposed all our
propositions for peace and amity?
Does he still live&mdash;and what is his
condition?" "I myself am the man,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
replied Red Jacket, "the decided
enemy of the Americans as long as
the hope of opposing them with success
remained, but now their true and
faithful ally until death."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN SHREWDNESS.</h2>

<p>When General Lincoln
went to make peace
with the Creek Indians,
one of the chiefs asked
him to sit down on a log. He
was then desired to move, and
in a few minutes to move still
further. The request was repeated
until the general got to the end of the
log. The Indian still said, "Move further,"
to which the general replied,
"I can move no further." "Just so
it is with us," said the chief; "you
have moved us back to the water,
and then ask us to move further."</p>

<h2>AN INDIAN'S JOKE.</h2>

<p>During the time of Indian
troubles, a friendly Indian
visited Governor
Jenks, of Rhode Island,
when the governor took occasion
to request him to let him
know if any strange Indian
should come to his wigwam. This
the Indian promised to do, and the
governor agreed to give him a mug
of flip if he should give such information.
Some time after, the Indian
came again, and said, "Well, Mr.
Gubernor, strange Indian come to
my house last night." "Ah," said
the governor, "what did he say?"
"He no speak," replied the Indian.
"What, not speak at all?" inquired
the governor. "No, he no speak at
all." "That looks suspicious," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his excellency, and inquired if he was
there still. Being told that he was,
the governor ordered the promised
mug of flip. When this was disposed
of, and the Indian was about to depart,
he mildly said, "Mr. Gubernor,
my squaw have child last night."
The governor, finding the strange
Indian was a new-born pappoose,
was glad to find there was no cause
for alarm.</p>

<h2>INDIAN CHARACTER.</h2>

<p>The following striking
display of Indian character
occurred some
years since in a town
in Maine. An Indian
of the Kennebec tribe,
remarkable for his good conduct,
received a grant of land from the
state, and fixed himself in a township,
where a number of families settled.
Though not ill treated, yet
the common prejudice against the
Indians prevented any sympathy
with him. This was shown at the
death of his only child, when none
of the people came near him. Shortly
afterwards he went to some of the
inhabitants, and said to them, "When
white man's child die, Indian man be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sorry&mdash;he help bury him: when my
child die, no one speak to me&mdash;I
make his grave alone&mdash;I can't live
here."</p>

<p>He gave up his farm, dug up the
body of his child, and carried it with
him two hundred miles through the
forest, to join the Canada Indians.
What energy and depth of feeling
does this specimen of Indian character
exhibit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<h2>INDIAN INTEGRITY.</h2>

<p>A Spanish traveller
met an Indian in
the desert; they
were both on
horseback. The
Spaniard, fearing
that his horse,
which was none
of the best, would
not hold out till
the end of his journey, asked the
Indian, whose horse was young,
strong, and spirited, to exchange
with him. This the Indian refused.
The Spaniard therefore began a
quarrel with him. From words
they proceeded to blows. The aggressor
being well armed, proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
too powerful for the native. He
seized his horse, mounted him, and
pursued his journey.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>He was closely followed
to the nearest
town by the Indian,
who immediately
complained
to a judge. The
Spaniard was obliged to appear, and
bring the horse with him. He treated
the Indian as an impostor, affirming
that the horse was his property,
that he had always had him in his
possession, and that he had raised
him from a colt.</p>

<p>There being no proof to the contrary,
the judge was about dismissing
the parties, when the Indian
cried out,&mdash;"The horse is mine,
and I'll prove it!" He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
took off his mantle, and with it instantly
covered the head of the animal;
then addressing the judge,&mdash;"Since
this man," said he, "affirms
that he has raised the horse from a
colt, command him to tell of which
eye he is blind." The Spaniard, who
would not seem to hesitate, instantly
answered, "Of the right eye." "He
is neither blind of the right eye," replied
the Indian, "nor of the left."</p>

<p>The judge decreed him the horse,
and the Spaniard to be punished as
a robber.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN POLITENESS.</h2>

<p>The politeness of these people
in conversation is indeed carried
to excess; since it does
not permit them to contradict or deny
the truth of what is asserted in
their presence. By this means they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
indeed avoid disputes; but then it
becomes difficult to know their
minds, or what impression you make
upon them. When any of them
come into our towns, our people are
apt to crowd around them, gaze upon
them, and incommode them when
they desire to be private; this they
esteem great rudeness, and the effect
of the want of instruction in the rules
of civility and good manners. "We
have," say they, "as much curiosity
as you, and when you come into our
towns, we wish for opportunities of
looking at you; but for this purpose
we hide ourselves behind bushes
where you are to pass, and never
intrude ourselves into your company."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
